## Features
* Header - At the top of thepage you have a header that contains the restaurants name (that also works as a button to get you back to the index.html site). It becomes larger when hovered to make it works as a link. The font is easy to read and has a style that suits this cool and popular restaurant. 

* Navigation - The navigation is easy to understand, and styled in a way that makes it very clear and visible. Each link becomes slightly larger when hovered, to make it obvious that they are meant to be pushed. The navigation takes you to the three different pages in the website. Home, about or feedback.
